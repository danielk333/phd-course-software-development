## Hybrid

The lectures will be shared via a dedicated zoom room which main purpose is for screen sharing and recording but the possibility exists to attend these by remote if absolutely needed. The best learning experience will be if one attends in person and can engage in the discussion directly.

> The link to the zoom room will be sent out to all participants via email

## Lecture structure

The general lecture will be structured as

1. Everyone joins the zoom room.
2. Each lecture starts with reviewing the homework assignments from last lecture. Each student will in turn screen share their code, describe it, and run it live. After everyone has shown their solutions we will have a short discussion on the different approaches.
3. The topic for the lectures is covered.
4. Homework assignments are handed out for the topic at hand.

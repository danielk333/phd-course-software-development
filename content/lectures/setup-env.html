                Lars Wirzenius, "40 years of programming"
                Interesting and significant software is beyond the capacity of any one person to build alone in a reasonable time frame. This means that the fundamental, crucial, core skills in building software are communication and collaboration.

                Even in the projects where I'm the only person, there are at least three people involved: past me, present me, and future me.
                ...
                Past me is a lazy and careless slob who always leaves a mess.
                Present me does superb work, but has to cope with all the stupid stuff done by past me, and needs to placate future me.
                Future me is an egotistic and opinionated snob for whom nothing is ever good enough.

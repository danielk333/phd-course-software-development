title: "Software design"
description: "Everyone who has written software has designed it, but many designs are unconscious. We should strive to making the important decisions conscious, informed, and efficient. This lecture covers what software design is and what it is generally not, what consequences design decisions have and how to walk the line between just doing and over-engineering. "

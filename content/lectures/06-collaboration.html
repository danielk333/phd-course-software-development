title: "Collaboration"
description: "Every large and successful software today is built in collaboration, either trough development or usage. Science itself has grown in complexity to where we need collaboration to be efficient and contemporary. Even if the code only has one developer, you will collaborate with your future self or the ones that eventually takes over or learns from you. This lecture covers vital requirements and tools for successful collaboration."

## Automation tools

There are many good online tutorials on using different automation tools, to mention a few,
CodeRefinery has arranged [snakemake hackathons and tutorials](https://coderefinery.github.io/snakemake_hackathon/Snakemake_intro/).

## Why automation

A while back I read [this blog
post](https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/) about a company that
owned about 400 million dollars in assets went bankrupt in about 45 minutes because of an error in a
manual deployment. It is an interesting story that I would recommend looking into. If you would
rather watch than read, there is of course a reaction video about the incident!

## Homework assignments

This task is simply to identify some workflow you have, whatever that may be, that would benefit
from automation, and then to automate it!

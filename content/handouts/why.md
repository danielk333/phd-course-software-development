### Recommended listening

Immersing one self in the art and culture of coding can be very enjoyable but also a good motivator to excel at that skill. If podcasts is something you enjoy, so here are some good recommendations to get started.

[The Science of Learning to Code](https://corecursive.com/the-science-of-learning-to-code/)
: An episode of the CoRecursive podcast on debunking myths about learning to code. This podcast also has many entertaining episodes on coding in general such as [Quines, Polyglot Code and Other Fun Computations](https://corecursive.com/quines-polyglot-code/).

[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)
: A podcast about hackers, cybercrime and other interesting topics on that theme. I can recommend many of the episodes both for entertainment, cyber security awareness, and to get more into hacker culture! A good starting episode on physical security is [Ep 6: The Beirut Bank Job](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/6/) and another one on cyber security is [Ep 130: Jason's Pen Test](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/130/).

## Design by example

*TODO: add a bunch of repositories to look trough for good design choices*

*TODO: find that video about design from a few year ago*


## Homework

### Code review

Do a group review of the practical task from the other groups, take some notes on design and
contrast with your own design decisions.

### Present your software

Choose a piece of software you have written, it could be something from your work or something you
developed during this course, such as the simple calculator. 

Prepare a flowchart outlining the design and present the design during the next lesson.

## Workflow

{{< tutorial colab_workflow "For a suggested first time workflow, see" >}}

There are also a few websites that go trough a lot of material on git workflows:

- [Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#BasePatterns)
- [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

## Python project template

> [!Notera]
> I have made a small python project template that contains a variaty of different settings structures and configurations, check it out here: [python-project-template](https://gitlab.irf.se/danielk/python-project-template). The website for this repository is published [here](https://danielk.developer.irf.se/python-project-template).

> [!Notera]
> I have also made a small example repository for project code that should _not_ be a package, but rather just scripts here: [python-scripts-template](https://gitlab.irf.se/danielk/python-scripts-template). It contains a different set of interesting features.


## Git material

A interactive game to learn git!

- [Oh-my-git](https://ohmygit.org/)

3.2 Git collaborative - CodeRefinery 2025 Mar

Material: [Code Refinery git collaborative ](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)

A few other good resources are:

- [Good set of standard `.gitignore` files](https://github.com/github/gitignore)


## License

Having a license is also vital to collaboration. To learn more I very much recommend the [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) website.

### Recommended listening

The podcast "CodingBlocks" did a small series called "Git from the bottom up" a few years ago. This podcast really opened my eyes about how git works. Even though it might go into detail I don't use every day I really think some of the understanding has really improved my git workflow.

As a warm-up or if you are very new to git, you can first listen to the [Understanding Git](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/understanding-git/) episode.

Listening trough these will take some time so take this as a long term goal. The episodes are linked in order below:

- [Blobs and Trees](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode191)
- [Commits](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode192)
- [Rebasing](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode193)
- [The Index](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode194)
- [Reset, Stash, and Reflog](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode195)

Then as a follow up, they also had an episode that covered different workflows that might be very relevant called [Comparing Git workflows](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/comparing-git-workflows/).

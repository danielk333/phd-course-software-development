## Workflow

{{< tutorial colab_workflow "For a suggested first time workflow, see" >}}

There are also a few websites that go trough a lot of material on git workflows:

- [Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html#BasePatterns)
- [Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

## Python project templates

{{< tutorial python_project "For python project templates, see" >}}

## Public keys

{{< tutorial public_keys "For instructions on how to get your public key, see" >}}

## Git material

### Oh-my-git

A interactive game to learn git! Highly recommended!

- [Oh-my-git](https://ohmygit.org/)

### CodeRefinery workshop

3.2 Git collaborative - CodeRefinery 2025 Mar
{{< youtube 4Uf7eVSCZeU >}}

Material: [Code Refinery git collaborative ](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)

### Other resources

A few other good resources are:

- [Good set of standard `.gitignore` files](https://github.com/github/gitignore)
- **More to be added here**

## License

Having a license is also vital to collaboration. To learn more I very much recommend the [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) website.

## Talks about trunk based development

code.talks 2023 - Our journey from Gitflow to Trunk Based Development
{{< youtube DDkjBqlks40 >}}

Also the start of this talk is a nice overview of why long lived branches can be problematic: [Real Programmers Commit To Master - Jakob Ehn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL1OZfgoZGk).

## Homework

### Recommended listening

The podcast "CodingBlocks" did a small series called "Git from the bottom up" a few years ago. This podcast really opened my eyes about how git works. Even though it might go into detail I don't use every day I really think some of the understanding has really improved my git workflow.

As a warm-up or if you are very new to git, you can first listen to the [Understanding Git](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/understanding-git/) episode.

Listening trough these will take some time so take this as a long term goal. The episodes are linked in order below:

- [Blobs and Trees](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode191)
- [Commits](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode192)
- [Rebasing](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode193)
- [The Index](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode194)
- [Reset, Stash, and Reflog](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode195)

Then as a follow up, they also had an episode that covered different workflows that might be very relevant called [Comparing Git workflows](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/comparing-git-workflows/).

Material: [Code Refinery git collaborative ](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/)

## License

Having a license is also vital to collaboration. To learn more I very much recommend the [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) website.

## Homework

### Recommended listening

The podcast "CodingBlocks" did a small series called "Git from the bottom up" a few years ago. This podcast really opened my eyes about how git works. Even though it might go into detail I don't use every day I really think some of the understanding has really improved my git workflow.

As a warm-up or if you are very new to git, you can first listen to the [Understanding Git](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/understanding-git/) episode.

So below are the episodes linked in order:

- [Blobs and Trees](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode191)
- [Commits](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode192)
- [Rebasing](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode193)
- [The Index](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode194)
- [Reset, Stash, and Reflog](https://www.codingblocks.net/episode195)

Then as a follow up, they also had an episode that covered different workflows that might be very relevant called [Comparing Git workflows](https://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/comparing-git-workflows/).

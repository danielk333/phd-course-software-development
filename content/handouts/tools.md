## Minimal setups

A cut down version of my current NeoVim setup which is still quite minimal can be found [here](https://gitlab.irf.se/danielk/starting-nvim#).

## vim-motions

A good article about the power of vim-motions, regardless of which editor you use, is 
[vim is not about speed](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/vim-is-not-about-speed-88968ae4283c).

A good starting tutorial on vim-motions can be found here:

And I like this video series on advanced motions:

## VsCode

Currently my [Code-OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) uses these extension

```bash
danielk@IRF033-danielk ~> code --list-extensions
bungcip.better-toml
danielgavin.ols
gruntfuggly.todo-tree
james-yu.latex-workshop
llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd
ms-python.black-formatter
ms-python.debugpy
ms-python.flake8
ms-python.python
redhat.vscode-yaml
streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-swedish
twxs.cmake
usernamehw.errorlens
waderyan.gitblame
```

I really like `ErrorLens` together with the `ms-python` suite as it gives me direct feedback on bad formatting, bugs, and syntax errors. Â´todo-tree` is really helpful in navigating across large projects that use the `# TODO:` style syntax. I also recommend the [VsCode-NeoVim](https://open-vsx.org/extension/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim) extension to start learning vim-motions: that's how I got started at one point.

There are a TON of tutorials on VsCode due to its popularity so I wont link any here.

## Sublime Text

Below are a few good starting points for beginning to master Sublime text posted on a Youtube channel dedicated to Sublime Text.

## NeoVim

Below is an example starting setup of `nvim` with most of the bells and whistles that you would want:

## Homework assignments

Debug a python program
: Take one of programs that you wrote in a homework task and step trough the code with either 1) pdb, 2) pudb, 3) spyder/VsCode/other built in debugger, 4) a general DAP interface.

Inventory of tools
: Write down what you generally use in terms of tooling while developing but also write a separate list of what you would like to have, now that you have seen a sample during the lecture. 

Watch / read / listen to material about your tools
: Choose some material that goes trough the usage of your tools. Be it from the suggestions above or something that you found by your self on the internet. Write down what you consumed and maybe some of the most important points you learned and share it with the class: it might help others!

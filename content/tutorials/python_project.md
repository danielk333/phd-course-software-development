## Python project template repository

I have made a small python project template that contains a variety of different settings, structures, 
and configurations, check it out here:
[python-project-template](https://gitlab.irf.se/danielk/python-project-template). The website for
this repository is published [here](https://danielk.developer.irf.se/python-project-template).

I have also made a small example repository for project code that should _not_ be a package, but
rather just scripts here:
[python-scripts-template](https://gitlab.irf.se/danielk/python-scripts-template). It contains a
different set of features and patterns.

> These examples are not minimal but a bit more involved, if you look at these at the start of the

> Also, you should not just copy them and use them as-is. Extract parts that _you need_ and clean

> copy-paste of a few of the config files to get started.

## Fill in your skill tree!

We have developed our own achievement sheet for this course! Have a look below.

![Data science achievement sheet](skill_tree/achievement_sheet_a4.png#.light)

The sheet was made using the awesome template developed by Steph Piper / Maker Queen in this [MakerSkillTree](https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree/) repository.

The idea is to print the image and mark in the boxes as you hit your achievements.

If you want to print the image, you can [click here](skill_tree/achievement_sheet_a4.png) to open
the image and then print (the "dark mode" version of the image is just for displaying, when printing
it is always white background and black text).

They also have a few other awesome skill-trees for general coding and for Linux which I have also
included below (Creative Commons Licence, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

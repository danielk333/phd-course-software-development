## Fill in your skill tree!

We have developed our own achievement sheet for this course! 

The sheet was made using the awesome template developed by Steph Piper / Maker Queen in this [sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree](https://github.com/sjpiper145/MakerSkillTree/) repository. Have a look below.

The idea is to print the image and mark in the boxes as you hit your achievements.

If you want to print the image, you open the image and then print rather than printing this page
(the "dark mode" version of the image is just for displaying, when printing it is always white
background and black text).

They also have a few other awesome skill-trees for general coding and for Linux which I have also
included below ([Creative Commons Licence, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)).

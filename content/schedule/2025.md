## Schedule

The course is designed to run over approximately 12 weeks.

This year it will run between:
- Start: Week 11 (2025-03-10)
- End: Week 23 (2025-06-05)

### Practicals

The course generally contains 3 larger practical tasks done in groups, these tasks are more complex and thus usually cannot be completed during a single session.

As such there will be three half-day hackatons where these tasks are started and then finished by the groups on their own until the next hackaton or the final lesson.

This year the hackatons will be:
- Hackaton 1: Week 13
- Hackaton 2: Week 17
- Hackaton 3: Week 20

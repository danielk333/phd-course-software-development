## Communication

There will be an email list created for all participants of the course. The main reporting about lecture dates and locations as well as practicals will be trough this list, e.g. if a lecture has to be moved it will come trough email.

If there are questions / discussion about the course, one can also send to this email list.

For discussing programming and asking questions I recommend using the [#python](https://irf-se.slack.com/archives/C06LSLX5VC3) slack channel on the IRF slack.

There is also the [#linux-users](https://irf-se.slack.com/archives/C074MQGHL67) channel for discussion about Linux systems.



## Schedule

The course is designed to run over approximately 12 weeks.

This year it will run between:
- Start: Week 11 (2025-03-10)
- End: Week 23 (2025-06-05)

### Practicals

The course contain two (2) larger practical tasks done in groups, these tasks are more complex and thus usually cannot be completed during a single session.

As such there will be three half-day hackathons where these tasks are started and worked on. They are then finished by the groups on their own.

This year the hackathons will be:
- Hackathon 1 - Practical 1: March 31 (Monday) 09:00 - 12:00 @ Aniara
- Hackathon 2 - Practical 2: Aprin 25 (Friday) 09:00 - 12:00 @ Aniara
- Hackathon 3 - Practical 2: End of course (TBD)
